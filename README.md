# Saccharine Artifice
Packaging a Chrome app is a pain. Packaging a URL as one? Less so. (Inline JS is _soooo_ much easier to deal with than having to attach every little listener, down to `onclick`, through the DOM.)

This is just the server for a certain temporary app.

I might keep this around for portfolio purposes, but the project will no longer be in active use as of Saturday 2017/05/25. I might adapt it into a generator, eventually. No promises, though.
